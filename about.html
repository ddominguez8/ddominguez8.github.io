            My name is David Dominguez, a first generation Computer Science and Engineering student currently enrolled at University of California, Merced, with an
        expected graduation date of December 2021. I'm originally from Elk Grove, California, and I am currently living in Merced, CA for school right now. I have an extremely strong work ethic, with a 
        very can-do attitude. I have a strong sense of responsibility and leadership, that can stem from my 15 years of playing soccer. Currently part of leadership for the Association for Computer Machinery,
        on campus, along with being part of the IrisSec CTF team. Our website with more information can be found <a href = "https://irissec.xyz/" >here.</a> I am an advocate for right to repair, as one of 
        first experiences playing with the inside of a computer was fixing my brother's Samsung Galaxy S4 Active, and without this experience I'm not sure I'd be where I am today. 
        <br/> <br/>
        Current projects I'm working on are: Personal website (ongoing), recreating Snake (initial stages), OvertheWire (Bandit 16->17), 
        C++ Udemy Course (45% complete), Python Udemy Course (10% complete), along with practicing online assessments on Leetcode and HackerRank.
        <br/> <br/>
        Past projects I've worked on are: Advent of Cyber 2, <a href = "https://github.com/ddominguez8/CSE-165/tree/master/FINAL%20PROJECT%20-%20SPACE%20INVADERS/textures/textures">Space Invaders</a> 
        (assignment for school, ran out of time and never fully completed to my liking), worked with NachOS for scheduling
        and other tasks in Operating Systems class, <a href = "https://github.com/camillevo/sachacks-best-project">SacHacks project</a> (also never fully completed, first time trying Blockstack)
