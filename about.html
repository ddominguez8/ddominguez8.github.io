            My name is David Dominguez, a first generation Computer Science and Engineering student currently enrolled at University of California, Merced, with an
        expected graduation date of December 2021. I'm from Elk Grove, California, and I am currently living in Merced, CA for school right now. I have an extremely strong work ethic, with a 
        very can-do attitude. I have a strong sense of responsibility and leadership, that can stem from my 15 years of playing soccer. Currently part of leadership for the Association for Computer Machinery,
        on campus, along with being part of the IrisSec CTF team. Our website with more information can be found <a href = "https://irissec.xyz/" >here.</a> I am an advocate for right to repair, as one of 
        first experiences playing with the inside of a computer was fixing my brother's Samsung Galaxy S4 Active, and without this experience I'm not sure I'd be where I am today. 
        <br/> <br/>
        Finally! We've gone over the boring stuff. You must be so curious, who <i>is</i> this cute little furball copying my morning face? Well, this is my cat, Alex, aka "Gordo". As of typing 
        this, he's currently a year and a half. His birthday is unknown to me right now, since he came to me at a gas station in Merced, and changed my life since I took him in. He's my first 
        pet I've ever owned, and he's enough of a handful to make sure I don't get another.
