        <br/><br/> 1/4/2020: Happy new year to everyone reading this! Today I've mostly been updating my resume along with adding an item into the navigation bar for the link 
        to the source code.

    <br/><br/> 12/28/2020: FINALLY I'm off break and off school for a bit. We've implemented the navigation bar, as well as all the pages and links along with it. We wrote up the about me page,
    however it needs some more revision.
